# The plan: 
I want to impliment a simple linear regression model to make predictions on the Boston Housing data set. The basic steps to impliment are as follows: 

1. Reading and parsing data - Reading from csv
2. Data pre-processing 
- Normalizing data (Z-score standardization) and handling missing values. 
- Splitting data into training and testing (70% training, 30% testing).
3. Linear Regression (Least squares method) Big step need to do matrix stuff and find out what I wanna SIMD
4. Make predictions
5. Evaluation -> Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-Squared (prolly MSE)
